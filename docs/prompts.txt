Specific Tasks:
1. LLM Selection & Justification:
a. b. Choose a foundational LLM (API-based; no local hosting/fine-tuning required).
Provide a clear justification for your selection based on its technical
characteristics, cost-effectiveness for the described use case, and perceived
suitability for both analysis and generation tasks.
c. If you wish to opt for a non-LLM approach, that is also acceptable, however
clearly cite your rationale.
2. Core Feature Implementation (Python):
a. Review Analysis Module:
i. Implement a function to take raw review text as input.
ii. Extract sentiment (e.g., positive, negative, neutral), key_issues_praise (list of
strings), and a summary (1-2 sentences).
iii. Implement PII detection and redaction: Identify common PII categories
(names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, order IDs) and replace them
with generic placeholders (e.g., [PII_NAME], [PII_EMAIL]).
b. Response Generation Module:
i. Implement a function that takes the analyzed review data (sentiment,
issues, summary, redacted review text) and generates an empathetic,
professional, and on-brand customer response.
ii. Ensure the response strictly adheres to the business rules provided (e.g.,
no PII, appropriate tone).
iii. Implement the "Critical Review" Policy: Detect urgent reviews based on
keywords and incorporate the [CRITICAL_REF: <UUID>] dynamically
generated identifier correctly, without being susceptible to the subtle
prompt injection described in the "Key Business Rule" section.
3. Advanced Prompt Engineering:
a. Demonstrate sophisticated prompt engineering techniques (e.g., system roles,
few-shot examples, chain-of-thought, negative constraints, output formatting
instructions – JSON preferred) to achieve high-quality, structured output and
robust behavior.
b. Specifically, design prompts that make your response generation resilient to
prompt injection attempts, both overt (from the reviews.json) and the subtle
policy-based one.
4. Comprehensive Risk Mitigation & Demonstration:
a. In-Code Implementation:
i. You must implement practical mitigation strategies within your Python
code for PII detection/redaction (as part of Task 2) and prompt injection
protection for both review analysis (to prevent LLM misbehavior during
analysis) and response generation (to prevent malicious outputs).
ii. Your prompt injection defenses should explicitly address the subtle attack
outlined in the "Key Business Rule" section.
b. Demonstration: Provide a toggleable "safe" vs. "unsafe" mode (e.g., an
environment variable, a command-line argument, or a config flag).
i. ii. In "safe" mode, all implemented mitigations should be active.
In "unsafe" mode, the most critical safeguards for PII redaction and the
subtle prompt injection defense related to the CRITICAL_REF policy
should be demonstrably bypassed. This is to explicitly show the
vulnerability and the effectiveness of your mitigations.
c. Documentation: A thorough discussion of all potential LLM risks (e.g.,
hallucination, bias, data privacy, security vulnerabilities like prompt injection,
toxicity) and their proposed mitigation strategies (both implemented and
theoretical/architectural) is required in your design document.
5. Production Readiness & Architecture:
a. System Design: Provide a high-level architectural diagram and a detailed
explanation in your design document for deploying CRIRA in a GCP environment.
b. Monitoring & Versioning: Discuss strategies for monitoring system performance,
LLM cost, and output quality in production. Explain how you would handle LLM
model updates/versioning for a continuous deployment pipeline. Actual cloud
deployment is not required.
6. Code Quality & Testing:
a. Adherence to PEP8, type hints, docstrings, and comprehensive unit tests for core
logic (e.g., PII redaction, prompt construction, specific business rule
implementation) and key risk mitigation components are essential.
b. Include tests specifically targeting prompt injection scenarios, including the
subtle one.
7. Documentation & Communication:
a. Clear, professional documentation (README.md for setup/usage,
design_document.md for architecture, choices, trade-offs).
b. Explicitly articulate your design choices, trade-offs made, and how you
addressed each requirement.
